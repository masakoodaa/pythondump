# Matkalla turhaan (Traveling in vain)

Matkalla turvaan (On the way to safety) is an educational board game in which the players are seeking refuge to Finland. The game is famous for being very frustrating. This horrible elif contraption I wrote during a jumping hour simulates playing the game so you don't have to. The code borrows some storyline from the actual game respecting copyright of the original creators. I do not hold copyright to the game consept or storyline. Please contact me in case of perceived copyright infringement.
