# taksibussi.py

"Plays" a game called taksibussi.

## What is taksibussi?
Taksibussi is a drinking game in which the participants list numbers in turn. If the number is divisible by three, the player must say "taksi" (taxi) instead of the number. If the number is divisible by five, the player must say "bussi" (bus) instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both, the player must say "taksibussi" instead of the number. Failure results in drinking or adding fuel to the fire if the game is played in a sauna (don't drink and sauna).

## How does taksibussi.py work?
